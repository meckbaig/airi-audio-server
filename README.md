# AIRI Audio Server 🎙️🚀

> **High-Performance, Zero-Python Node.js & C++ Audio Microservice for AIRI**

`airi-audio-server` is a lightweight, zero-Python Node.js microservice designed to serve C++ audio inference (`audio.cpp` C++ engine) with **OpenAI API compatibility**, **SSE Incremental Audio Streaming**, **Native Parakeet TDT ASR**, **Voice Discovery & Batch Transcription**, and **Unified GPU Task Queueing**.

---

## ⚡ Core Features & Architectural Innovations

1. **Incremental Audio Streaming over SSE (`stream_format: "sse"`)**:
   - `POST /v1/audio/speech` supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming without requiring text splitting.
   - Emits base64-encoded, self-contained 44-byte WAV chunks (`pcmToWav`) in real time, dropping Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) to ~230ms while preserving 100% natural utterance prosody.
2. **Native Parakeet TDT ASR (`src/stt.js` & `tools/transcribe-voices.js`)**:
   - Runs `audiocpp_cli` with `Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3` on CUDA GPU for Speech-to-Text reference transcription and unloads immediately, keeping VRAM free for TTS synthesis.
   - Includes automatic FFmpeg normalization (WebM/Opus/MP3 -> 16kHz PCM WAV).
   - Batch voice transcript utility: `npm run transcribe-voices` rebuilds high-accuracy reference transcripts for all cloned voices to ensure peak zero-shot voice cloning fidelity.
3. **Zero-Compilation Out-Of-The-Box Execution**:
   - Ships with pre-compiled CUDA release binaries bundled in `bin/windows-cuda/`.
   - If a local `audio.cpp` build is not found, `engine.js` automatically falls back to the bundled C++ server binary.
4. **1-Click Verified Model Auto-Downloader**:
   - `setup.js` / `install.bat` automatically fetches 100% verified `.gguf` model weights (both TTS models and Parakeet TDT ASR) directly from HuggingFace with live progress tracking.
5. **Robust Child Process Hot-Swapping & Safety**:
   - Detaches all event handlers before killing terminating instances and explicitly awaits process exit before spawning replacements (`waitForExit`), preventing port 8080 collisions and race conditions during model/voice switches.
6. **Configurable Idle Keepalive Warmer**:
   - Optional lightweight ping to mitigate GPU power-state / CUDA paging cold-start delays.
   - **Default set to `0` (disabled)** so no background inferences run or compete when ComfyUI or other workloads run in parallel.
7. **Zero File Deletion Policy & Automatic Archiving**:
   - Voice reference files are **never deleted**. Replaced or updated voice files are automatically preserved with timestamped backups in `voices/archive/`.
8. **Shared Ingestion & Short Audio Normalization (`src/voices.js` & `src/ffmpeg.js`)**:
   - Converts uploaded audio clips to 24kHz mono PCM WAV via FFmpeg safely (handling in-place normalization).
   - Self-concatenates reference clips shorter than 1.5s to 3–5 seconds so zero-shot voice cloning never fails.
9. **Unified Serialized GPU Queue (`src/queue.js`)**: Single FIFO queue for all GPU tasks (TTS synthesis, STT transcriptions, voice registrations), preventing VRAM collisions.
10. **Real-Time Factor (RTF) Metrics & Headers**: Computes exact latency, audio duration, RTF, and real-time speed, returning them in custom HTTP headers (`X-Real-Time-Factor`, `X-Realtime-Speed`, `X-Synthesis-Latency-Ms`, `X-Audio-Duration-Sec`).

## 🧩 GPU Backends (CUDA / Vulkan / CPU)

The inference backend is fully configurable and never falls back to CPU silently.

```json
"gpu": {
  "backend": "auto",
  "device": 0,
  "vulkan_sdk_path": ""
}
```

- `auto` (default): **CUDA** when a real NVIDIA GPU is detected, otherwise **Vulkan** when a Vulkan-capable adapter is present (e.g. AMD Radeon), otherwise a hard error.
- Environment overrides: `AIRI_GPU_BACKEND=cuda|vulkan|cpu` and `AIRI_GPU_DEVICE=<index>`.
- The NVIDIA/CUDA path is unchanged: bundled binaries in `bin/windows-cuda/` keep working.
- **AMD users:** see [`docs/AMD_VULKAN.md`](docs/AMD_VULKAN.md) and run `install-vulkan.bat`.

Diagnose the selected backend and GPU device at any time:

```cmd
npm run gpu-info
```

---

## 🚀 1-Click Automated Setup

Double-click `install.bat` on Windows! The installer automatically:
1. Installs Node.js dependencies (`npm install`).
2. Verifies FFmpeg in system PATH (or offers automatic installation via `winget`).
3. Clones the official `audio.cpp` C++ engine repository if missing (`git clone https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp`).
4. Detects your GPU backend and builds the matching `audio.cpp` release binaries (`audiocpp_server.exe`, `audiocpp_cli.exe`) — CUDA or Vulkan — reporting exactly which prerequisites are missing.
5. Launches the interactive model setup wizard (`node setup.js`), then prints GPU/backend diagnostics.

```cmd
install.bat
```

For an AMD Radeon GPU (Vulkan), use the dedicated installer instead:

```cmd
install-vulkan.bat
```

## 🔬 Production Insights & Benchmarks (Theory vs. Practice)

Field verification on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU (8GB VRAM) revealed several important practical considerations:

1. **Stable Audio 3 Small SFX (`POST /v1/audio/sfx`)**:
   - **Theoretical Expectations**: Fast diffusion, low footprint.
   - **Empirical Reality**: Generates a 3.0s stereo sound effect in **10.59s** (8 rectified flow steps). Memory consumption sits at **~1.6 GB VRAM**, making it fully safe to run concurrently or sequentially without triggering CUDA out-of-memory errors on 8GB GPUs.
   - **Acoustics**: Native 44.1 kHz stereo audio with true stereo imaging and reverb tail.

2. **MOSS-VoiceGenerator (`POST /v1/audio/voice-design`)**:
   - **Theoretical Expectations**: Generates speech from instructions; decoding parameters require delicate tuning.
   - **Empirical Reality**: Generates a 5.84s utterance in **40.55s** (~6.9x RTF). Consumes **~3.8 GB VRAM**.
   - **Sampling Sensitivity**: Must use the curated decoding defaults (`audio_temperature=1.5`, `audio_top_p=0.6`, `audio_top_k=50`, `audio_repetition_penalty=1.1`). Generic TTS sampling presets cause the model to prematurely terminate on the first frame.
   - **Auto-Ingestion Pipeline**: Specifying `save_as_voice: "voice_id"` in the POST body normalizes the output to 24kHz mono PCM WAV, saves it into `voices/<voice_id>.wav`, writes the ground-truth text sidecar (`voices/<voice_id>.txt`), and automatically advertises the new voice to `GET /v1/voices` for instantaneous zero-shot voice cloning with OmniVoice, Higgs Audio, or Fish Audio!

3. **Unified Serialization (`src/queue.js`)**:
   - Both Voice Design and SFX commands are dispatched through the server's serialized FIFO GPU queue. This prevents VRAM thrashing when synthesis requests arrive while TTS or music generation is in progress.
